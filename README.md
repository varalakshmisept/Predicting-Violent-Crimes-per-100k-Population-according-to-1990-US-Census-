# Predicting-Violent-Crimes-per-100k-Population-according-to-1990-US-Census-
The main areas where I wanted to do my analysis was to predict what factors contribute to violent crimes in a society. Firstly, I wanted to analyze if the number of vacant houses in a locality or the period the house was vacant had any significant contribution to the crime rate. Unemployment is another factor which contribute proportionally to crime rate, therefore I wanted to analyze if the unemployment rate directly affects the crime rate in a community. The next thing I wanted to concentrate on was age. As the age of the defaulter describes the state of mind I wanted to analyze if a certain age group was more vulnerable to crime. It is believed that people from certain ethnicity are more prone to commit and crime than others thus I wanted to analyze and confirm if people from a ethnicity are prone to crime. Education plays and important role in shaping a childâ€™s mind, thus with the information in the dataset I have analyzed if education helps bring down the crime rate.
